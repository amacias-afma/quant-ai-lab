    "# 📘 Theoretical Reference: The Mathematics of Volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1\\. The Benchmark: GARCH(1,1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity** (Bollerslev, 1986) is the industry standard for modeling volatility clustering (\"shocks tend to be followed by large changes\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 The Core Process\n",
    "\n",
    "We model the returns $r_t$ as:\n",
    "$$r_t = \\sigma_t z_t$$\n",
    "where $z_t \\sim N(0,1)$ is a standard normal innovation (white noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance $\\sigma^2_t$ evolves according to the specific **GARCH(1,1)** dynamic:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma^2_t = \\omega + \\alpha \\epsilon^2_{t-1} + \\beta \\sigma^2_{t-1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **$\\omega$ (Omega):** The baseline variance constant.\n",
    "  * **$\\epsilon^2_{t-1}$ (Lagged Squared Residual):** Represents the \"Shock\" or \"News\" from yesterday. The coefficient $\\alpha$ measures the **reaction speed** to market events.\n",
    "  * **$\\sigma^2_{t-1}$ (Lagged Variance):** Represents the \"Memory\" of the system. The coefficient $\\beta$ measures the **persistence** of volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Key Constraints (The \"Sanity Checks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "For the model to be physically valid in finance, we must satisfy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Positivity:** $\\omega > 0, \\alpha \\ge 0, \\beta \\ge 0$. (Variance cannot be negative).\n",
    "2.  **Stationarity:** $\\alpha + \\beta < 1$.\n",
    "      * If $\\alpha + \\beta = 1$, it is an **IGARCH** (Integrated GARCH) model, meaning shocks persist forever (infinite memory).\n",
    "      * If $\\alpha + \\beta > 1$, the variance explodes to infinity over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Long-Run Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "If the process is stationary, it reverts to a mean unconditional variance $V_L$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_L = \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^2] = \\frac{\\omega}{1 - \\alpha - \\beta}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why this matters:* In stress testing, we often check if the current volatility is significantly higher than $V_L$ to detect crisis regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\n",
    "\n",
    "We find parameters $(\\omega, \\alpha, \\beta)$ by maximizing the Log-Likelihood of the observed returns. Assuming Normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left( \\ln(2\\pi) + \\ln(\\sigma^2_t) + \\frac{r_t^2}{\\sigma^2_t} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* The term $\\frac{r_t^2}{\\sigma^2_t}$ is crucial. It tries to make the ratio of \"Actual Return\" to \"Predicted Volatility\" close to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2\\. The Challenger: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) suffer from the **Vanishing Gradient Problem**: they cannot learn correlations across long time lags (e.g., a shock 30 days ago affecting today). LSTMs solve this with a \"Gating\" mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 The Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM cell maintains a **Cell State ($C_t$)** (Long-term memory) and a **Hidden State ($h_t$)** (Short-term output).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Forget Gate ($f_t$):** \"What should I forget from the past?\"\n",
    "    $$f_t = \\sigma(W_f \\cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "      * $\\sigma$ is the Sigmoid function (outputs 0 to 1). If 0, information is erased.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Input Gate ($i_t$):** \"What new information matters?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$i_t = \\sigma(W_i \\cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)$$\n",
    "    Where $W_i$ are the weights, $h_{t-1}$ is the previous hidden state, $x_t$ is the current input, and $b_i$ are the biases.\n",
    "    $$ \\tilde{C}_t = \\tanh(W_C \\cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)$$\n",
    "    (Candidate new memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Cell State Update:** The core engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \\tilde{C}_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "      * *Interpretation:* Old memory is scaled by \"forget factor\" + New memory is scaled by \"input importance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Output Gate ($o_t$):** \"What should I reveal to the next step?\"\n",
    "    $$o_t = \\sigma(W_o \\cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)$$\n",
    "    $$h_t = o_t * \\tanh(C_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Why LSTMs for Volatility?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Non-Linearity:** Unlike GARCH (which is linear in parameters), LSTMs can approximate complex non-linear functions (Universal Approximation Theorem).\n",
    "  * **Regime Switching:** The gating mechanism allows the model to \"switch\" behavior. For example, during a crash, the **Input Gate** might fully open to react to new shocks, while in calm markets, the **Forget Gate** dominates to maintain the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3\\. The Loss Function: QLIKE (Quasi-Likelihood)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the \"Bridge\" between AI and Econometrics. We do not use MSE. We use a Physics-Informed loss derived from the likelihood of volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume returns follow $r_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_t)$, the negative log-likelihood (ignoring constants) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Loss = \\ln(\\sigma^2_t) + \\frac{r_t^2}{\\sigma^2_t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In our code, we implemented this as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "loss = torch.log(pred_var) + (target_sq_ret / pred_var)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Gradient Analysis (Why it's safer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the gradient (derivative) of the loss with respect to the predicted variance $h = \\sigma^2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial h} = \\frac{1}{h} - \\frac{y^2}{h^2} = \\frac{1}{h} \\left( 1 - \\frac{y^2}{h} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Case A: Over-estimation ($h > y^2$):** The model predicts high risk, but reality is calm. The gradient is small. The model gently corrects down.\n",
    "  * **Case B: Under-estimation ($h < y^2$):** The model predicts calm, but reality crashes ($y^2$ is huge). The term $\\frac{y^2}{h^2}$ becomes **massive**.\n",
    "  * **Result:** The gradient explodes. The model is \"screamed at\" by the optimizer to increase variance immediately. This asymmetry makes QLIKE inherently **risk-averse**, which is exactly what we want for a VaR model."
